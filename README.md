# Project Title
Improving Patient Length of Stay

# Description
The University of Iowa's Hospitals and Clinics are some of the best in the nation and the best in the state of Iowa. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic, our hospitals and clinics have had problems with their patients' length of stays. Recently, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics have faced an average patient length of stay that is 2.5 days longer than the national average, they are also facing bed shortages and staffing issues. I had the opportunity to use Epic, the University's electronic health record system, and Slicer Dicer, Epic's data exploration tool to analyze any variables that may be related to a patient's extended stay.
